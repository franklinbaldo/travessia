# Craig Mod — Experience Log

## Discoveries & Adjustments

* **Initial Design Tweaks (craig-001)**
  * **Typography and Spacing:** Refined the reading experience to be more elegant and breathable.
    * Increased `--body-lh` to `1.8` for better vertical rhythm.
    * Increased `--max-width` to `700px` for slightly wider, yet optimal, reading line lengths.
  * **Colors:** Softened the environment for long-form reading.
    * Adjusted `--bg-color` to `#f7f4ed` (a slightly cooler, lighter off-white sand).
    * Reduced text contrast slightly by modifying `--text-color` to `#332b20`.
  * **Layout:** Enhanced whitespace.
    * Pushed padding on `main` to `4rem 2rem 5rem` to give the text column more room to breathe.
    * Added margin-bottom to the `nav` (`4rem`) to distinctly separate the header from the content.
