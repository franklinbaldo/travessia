  Guide for conducting literary research as a novelist — the craft of extracting
  fiction-ready material (scenes, voices, tensions, images) from sources through
  structured dialogue, interviews, field work, and document analysis. Use this
  skill when asked to help with novel research, to design research protocols for
  fiction, to extract usable material from conversations or documents, to
  evaluate whether gathered material serves a narrative, or to plan research
  phases for a novel-in-progress. Also use when building dialogue systems,
  interview frameworks, or character-mining processes for literary projects.
  Trigger on: "novel research", "research for fiction", "literary field work",
  "mining for material", "character research", "dialogue-as-research", "fiction
  preparation", or any request to systematically gather and evaluate material
  for a literary work.

# Literary Research for Novel Writing

A craft guide for novelists doing research — not the academic kind, but the kind
that produces fiction-ready material: scenes you can use, voices you can hear,
tensions that generate plot, images that survive revision.

Based on the practice of writers who treat research as a creative act: Ted
Chiang's philosophical scaffolding, W.G. Sebald's archival wandering, Elena
Ferrante's social excavation, Roberto Bolaño's biographical mining, Guimarães
Rosa's sertão fieldwork (the 1952 cattle drive notebooks), and the epistolary
research traditions from Rilke's letters to Flaubert's correspondence.

## The Core Distinction

**Academic research** answers questions. **Literary research** generates
material.

Material is not information. Information tells you what happened. Material lets
you write what happened as if you were there. Material has:

- **Voice**: you can hear someone saying it
- **Image**: you can see something specific
- **Tension**: something unresolved, something that resists easy resolution
- **Physicality**: sensory detail — what it smelled like, what the light was
  doing, what sound was underneath the silence

If your research produces facts but no material, you have notes. If it produces
material, you have the raw substance of fiction.

## Five Research Modes

### 1. Dialogue-as-Research

The most productive mode for character-driven fiction. You talk to someone —
real or constructed — not to extract information but to **provoke material**.

**The interviewer's posture:**

- You are not a journalist. You don't need the whole story. You need the
  **moment** — the detail, the image, the phrase that survives compression
- You are not a therapist. You don't need emotional truth. You need **dramatic**
  truth — the version of events that generates conflict, tension, surprise
- You are not a scholar. You don't need accuracy. You need **vividness** — the
  wrong detail remembered intensely is worth more than the right detail
  remembered flatly

**Technique — Provocative Presentation:**

Present your thesis (the philosophical, structural, or thematic spine of the
novel) to your research subject in accessible language. Then listen to what
comes back. The research subject's **resistance** is more valuable than their
agreement. Where they push back, where they misunderstand productively, where
they offer a counter-example from experience — that's where the fiction lives.

**What to capture:**

- Exact phrases (not paraphrased — the words they actually used)
- Stories that came unbidden (the memory that surfaced because you said
  something that triggered it, not because you asked for it)
- Reformulations (when they say your idea back to you in their own language, and
  the translation changes the idea)
- Questions (especially questions you can't answer — these become the novel's
  open wounds)
- Disagreements (every disagreement is a potential scene)

**Session structure:**

1. Respond to whatever they said last (never ignore their previous contribution)
2. Present one idea — only one — in concrete, physical language
3. Ask genuinely: what does this remind you of? How would you say this?
4. Listen for the material. It's almost never in the direct answer. It's in the
   digression, the aside, the story they tell to avoid answering

### 2. Archival Wandering

Research in documents, photographs, maps, records — not looking for specific
information but for the **accidental detail** that no one would invent.

**The Sebald method:**

- Go to archives without a precise question
- Read adjacent materials (the document next to the one you came for)
- Follow names, dates, and places that appear in margins
- Photograph everything; sort later
- The connection between two unrelated documents is the plot

**What to capture:**

- The specific rather than the general (not "prices were high" but "a loaf of
  bread cost three days' wages")
- Procedural details (how things were actually done — the sequence of steps in a
  process, the tools used, the time it took)
- Proper nouns (real names, real places, real streets — even if you'll change
  them later, they anchor imagination)
- Errors and anomalies in records (where documents contradict each other,
  there's a story)

### 3. Field Work

Going to the place. Walking the ground. Rosa's 1952 cattle drive — ten days on
horseback across the sertão, filling notebooks — produced the sensory foundation
for everything he wrote afterward.

**What to capture:**

- Sensory inventory: what each sense registers, hour by hour. The light at 6am
  is different from the light at 2pm. The sound of a place at night is different
  from the sound at noon. Write it all.
- Movement vocabulary: how people walk, gesture, sit, eat, work in this place.
  The body language of a specific geography and culture.
- Overheard language: not interviews — fragments. The phrase you catch walking
  past a conversation. The way someone calls a child. The word for a thing that
  has no word elsewhere.
- Maps: not cartographic maps — emotional maps. Where do people go? What do they
  avoid? What's the dangerous part? What's the sacred part?

### 4. Philosophical Scaffolding

The Ted Chiang mode: start with an idea — a thesis, a thought experiment, a
what-if — and build the novel as a structure that lets the reader **experience**
the idea rather than understand it.

**Process:**

1. Articulate the thesis in the clearest, most compressed form possible (one
   paragraph)
2. Identify the **experiential core**: what would it feel like to live this
   thesis? What would change in daily life if this were true?
3. Find the character who lives at the **fault line** of the thesis — the person
   for whom this idea is not abstract but urgent, personal, survival-level
4. The research question becomes: what does this person's life look like? What
   are the ordinary details of an extraordinary situation?

**The scaffolding must be invisible.** If the reader can see the thesis, the
novel has failed. The idea should be the skeleton, not the skin.

### 5. Biographical Mining

Using a real or fictional person's life as a quarry. Not biography — **mining**.
You take what serves the fiction and leave the rest.

**Ethical principle:** You owe the material your full attention. You don't owe
it accuracy. The moment you subordinate the fiction to the facts, you've stopped
writing a novel and started writing a profile.

**What to mine:**

- Contradictions in character (the brave person's cowardice, the generous
  person's hidden cruelty)
- Turning points (moments where the person became someone else — and the detail
  that reveals the turn)
- Relationships as systems (not "A loved B" but "A needed B to be X, and B
  needed A to be Y, and neither could deliver")
- The unsaid (what the person never talks about — the gap in the narrative is
  the most interesting part)

## The Material Evaluation Framework

Not everything gathered is usable. Use these filters:

### The Five Tests

1. **Can I hear it?** If the material includes a voice — a phrase, a rhythm, a
   way of speaking — it's strong. Voiceless material is weak.

2. **Can I see it?** If the material produces a specific image (not a concept,
   an image — a color, a gesture, a spatial arrangement), it's strong.

3. **Does it resist?** If the material is comfortable, agrees with your thesis,
   confirms what you already thought — it's weak. The best material pushes back,
   complicates, refuses to fit.

4. **Is it surprising?** If you could have invented it without doing the
   research, you didn't need the research. The value of research is what you
   couldn't have imagined.

5. **Does it compress?** Can this material become a scene? A sentence? An image?
   If it only works as exposition or explanation, it belongs in your notes, not
   your novel.

### The Three Categories

After gathering material, sort into:

- **Scenes**: material that has enough specificity (place, voice, action,
  tension) to become a scene in the novel. These are gold.
- **Texture**: material that provides sensory or cultural detail — vocabulary,
  gestures, smells, procedures — that makes scenes believable. This is the
  mortar between the bricks.
- **Spine**: material that clarifies, complicates, or restructures the novel's
  thesis or architecture. This changes the plan. It's the most valuable and the
  most dangerous category.

## Research Documentation

### The Research Journal

Not a diary. A **working document** that evolves across sessions.

**After each research session, record:**

1. **Best material** (exact quotes, images, stories — with source reference)
2. **Surprises** (what you didn't expect to find)
3. **Resistances** (where your thesis was challenged — and whether the challenge
   was productive)
4. **Connections** (how today's material links to material from previous
   sessions)
5. **Questions generated** (what you now need to find out that you didn't know
   you needed)
6. **Novel implications** (how this material changes the plan — new scenes, new
   characters, structural shifts)

### The Material Index

A running inventory of usable material, organized by category:

- **Phrases** (exact language that could appear in the novel — always with
  source)
- **Scenes** (material that has enough body to become a scene — one-line
  summary + source)
- **Characters** (traits, contradictions, gestures, speech patterns extracted
  from research)
- **Images** (specific sensory details that anchor the fictional world)
- **Tensions** (unresolved questions, disagreements, contradictions — the
  dramatic fuel)

### The Living Blueprint

The novel plan that changes as research accumulates. Key principles:

- The blueprint is never finished until the novel is finished
- Every research session has the right to alter the blueprint
- Material that doesn't fit the current blueprint is not discarded — it's
  stored. It may be the material that eventually breaks the blueprint open into
  something better
- The blueprint tracks what's covered and what's missing — not just thematically
  but materially. You may have the thesis for chapter 7 but no scene, no voice,
  no image. That's a research gap.

## Research Rhythms

### The Session

One focused research interaction (a dialogue, an archive visit, a field day).
Produces:

- Raw material (notes, quotes, images)
- A journal entry
- Updates to the material index

### The Phase

A cluster of sessions focused on a particular aspect of the novel (a character,
a setting, a thematic strand). A phase ends when you have enough material to
draft — not enough material to finish, enough to **start**.

### The Spiral

You will return to the same sources, the same people, the same places — but with
different questions, because the novel has changed since the last visit. The
second visit produces different material from the first. The third produces
different material from the second. Research is not linear; it spirals.

## The Novelist's Ethic of Research

1. **Respect your sources.** The people and places you research are not
   instruments. Give them your full attention. Listen more than you speak. If
   someone gives you a story, that's a gift.

2. **Steal well.** All fiction is theft. The art is in what you steal and how
   you transform it. Take the phrase, the gesture, the image — but make it serve
   a new context, a new meaning. The transformation is the craft.

3. **Know when to stop.** Research can become avoidance. When you have enough
   material to draft, draft. You can always research more later. But the novel
   exists only when you start writing it.

4. **Let the material change the plan.** If your research contradicts your
   outline, the research is probably right. The world is more interesting than
   your plan for it. The best novels are the ones that outgrew their blueprints.

5. **The research is not the novel.** No matter how beautiful your material, the
   reader will never see it directly. They'll see the fiction you built from it.
   The research is scaffolding. The novel is the building. When the building
   stands, the scaffolding comes down.
